						Welcome everyone to the first session of dariel Web guild over the next couple sessions we will go over our stack, tooling, Modern Web Architecture, Build & deploy. So the aim for these Web Guilds knowledge share sessions will be to go deep into the Stack, Tooling, Architecture, Build & Deploy.

								- Angularjs
								- Jasmine
								- Protractor - angularjs functional testing framework
								- Gruntjs
								- SASS (responsive design)
								- Node and NPM
								- Webstorm - IDE
								- Go CD, Bamboo - Build server
								- Git - repository

						<aside class="notes">
							Angularjs for front-end (Client) MVC framework, Jasmine we use for BDD style tests, Protractor - angularjs functional testing framework, Gruntjs task runners. So thru every session we will dive into these areas, example how we unit test our controllers, services and directives.

						<h2>Modern Web Architecture</h2>
						<p>So before we look the modern web Architecture. I'd like go over the where we came from, by looking at the evolution of Web Development.</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							So when I started web developing application development, we called Web Masters back in those days. So there was Static HTML and if you wanted to something dynamic like display web visit counter (remember those). Back when I was at Parktown Boys's I had created a website for the Geography department and I wanted to display a web visit counter, and that's when I discovered that the HTML part of the website just gives you a static stuff for dynamic stuff there was something I had to do on the server. When I investigated I advised to use some sort of CGI scripting. So after digging around the interwebs I found some script uploaded it and we had a web visit counter. So the evolution has been:

					<h2>Static Websites</h2>
					<h3>HTML</h3>
					<pre class="hljs">
		+-----------------------------------+
		|         CLIENT - WEB BROWSER      |
		+---------------^-------------------+
				| [HTML]
		+---------------v-------------------+
		|              HTML                 | [SERVER]
		+-----------------------------------+
					</pre>

					<h2>Dynamic Websites</h2>
					<h3>The Spaghetti Revolution</h3>
					<pre class="hljs">

		+-----------------------------------+
		|         CLIENT - WEB BROWSER      |
		+---------------^-------------------+
				| [HTML,FORM-POSTS,AJAX]
		+---------------v-------------------+
		| HTML, CSS, JavaScrip + ASP or PHP | [SERVER]
		+-----------------------------------+
					</pre>
					<p>Mixing server side code ASP or PHP withing HTML (the spaghetti revolution), it wasnt pretty but it worked. And also some JavaScript libraries like JQuery and MooTools.
						JQuery and PHP won these battles </p>
					<aside class="notes">
						This was a crazy period...

						<h2>Web Frameworks</h2>
						<h3>Convention Over Configuration</h3>
										<pre class="hljs">
		+-----------------------------------+
		|         CLIENT - WEB BROWSER      |
		+---------------^-------------------+
				| [HTML,FORM-POSTS,AJAX]
		+---------------v-------------------+
		| Ruby on Rails (MVC), ASP.NET MVC  | [SERVER]
		+-----------------------------------+
										</pre>
						<p>DHH (David Heinemeier Hansson) changed the game created Ruby on Rails which based on MVC pattern, it was a very popular framework. Others followed like ASP.NET MVC, Codeigniter PHP MVC</p>

						<aside class="notes">
							Convention over configuration is a software design paradigm which seeks to decrease the number of decisions that developers need to make, gaining simplicity, and not necessarily losing flexibility.

							Before web frameworks It was chaos, people were using ASP.NET & PHP which ever way they wanted.

							So with this we able to create Web Application which started rivaling Desktop applications.

							Then mobile devices started become popular new problems arose, smaller screens, slower network speeds because 2g and 3g. Granted you could create responsive web applications we still had another needs. example wanting to have a native app for the mobile device but consuming the same data.

						<h2>RESTful APIs</h2>

								Now we have these JavaScript Front-End Frameworks (Angularjs, Emberjs) which are inspired by this mobile evolution. So whether your on Web or Mobile you want consume the same RESTful API, so more computation is being handled on the front-end and the communication back and forth is JSON. This is Modern Web Architecture that we use, some of the benefits are:
								- Scaling, Better UI, SPAs (Single Page Applications), Testing, More value for customer

					<h2>Summary</h2>
					<h3 class="">Together we will tame this beast that is web development</h3>
					<p>
						Web Development has been evolving at a very fast pace, there's new libraries, new techniques of how to do things and etc... This stuff can quickly become overwhelming when starting a new project, which front-end MVC framework do you go with  AngularJS OR EmberJS, what about ReactJS, all these things. So therefore through this Web Guild, will be sharing amongst each, what has worked, what has not worked, which stack and tooling to use and etc... So together we will tame this beast that is web development
